## Poblem to solve:

When setting up t-shirt designs for customer, I often use my judgement as to what shirt colors to put the desgn on, or the customer has some initial requests for shirt colors. Setting up proofs on each shirt color is a time consuming task, and I often settle with only picking a few colors to present the design on. Often times, the customer wants to see more options. The back and forth is time consuming.

This project is aimed to cut out all of that time. I want the customer to be able to quickly see their design on any number of shirt colors.

## Additional thoughts:

### To allow uploads or not?

I like that the user can upload any image, that makes the page useful while only neediing one page. Why I don't like that is it's asking too much from the customer. It would be nice to be able to send a link and the design already be present on the shirt. Yes, that's easier to do than the file upload solution I have in place, but it requires making a new page for every design. That is an awesome solution, but it's a solution that might come later.

### SVG?

I'm thinking about making the design image an SVG. That would allow the user to not only select the garment color, but they would also be able to select ink colors for the design. That is easy to do if I create a unique page for every design. I'm not sure how to do that if I allow the customer to upload an image. Also, I don't want to provide customers with SVG fles for them to use with thios app.

### Sass?

I'm still using Sass to ohandle variables in CSS. CSS now supports variables, so I'm not sure why I am still using Sass. I do like the way Sass looks, but is that a good reason?
